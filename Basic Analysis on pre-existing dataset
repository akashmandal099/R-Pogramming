# Let us import the package MASS

library(MASS)                           # This loads the package MASS
library(help = MASS)                    # To check information about package MASS
View(airquality)                        # To view the data of dataframe airquality

mean(airquality$Temp)                   # This gives the mean value of Temp in dataframe airquality
median(airquality$Temp)                 # This gives the median value of Temp in dataframe airquality
quantile(airquality$Temp,probs = 0.75)  # This gives the 75th percentile value of Temp in dataframe airquality


S1=airquality[airquality$Month == 6,]   # This creates a subset S1 of airquality dataframe - contains all days in month of June
View(S1)                                # To view the contents (data) of subset dataframe S1

plot(x=S1$Temp,y=S1$Solar.R)            # This plots Temp and Solar.R on X and Y axes of dataframe S1

median(S1$Solar.R)                      # The median value of Solar.R in dataframe S1 will be displayed.
